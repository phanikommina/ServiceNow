UI Actions: 

>> UI action is like a button, it can show upon a form, button, Context menu, as a link(under related links).

>> By clicking on "client" checkbox we can run the UI actions in client side also.

>> Basically UI actions will run on server side.

>> current object can be used in server side only

>> UI actions are condition based buttons

>> We can write th both client and server side code in the UI action script itself.. by declaring the two functions one for client and another one for server.

Example : Reopen incident

function reopenincident(){
	
	var desc = g_form.getValue('description');
	
	if(desc==''){
		
		alert('Description should be manadatory to reopen the incident');
		g_form.setMandatory('description', true);
		return false;
	}

	gsftSubmit(null, g_form.getFormElement(), 'reopen_inc'); //MUST call the 'Action name' set in this UI Action
