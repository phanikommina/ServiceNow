Data Sources: Source of the data which we have to import into servicenow staging table.4

Transform map: To move the data from source table to target table by using the field maps, we will use transform maps.

Coalesce: If you set to coalesce as true for the unique field it will check if the record is already there in the table or not, if not there it will create. 
If record is there then it will update.

Ans: By setting the coalsce as true.

>> We can set the coalsce for multiple fields as well.
