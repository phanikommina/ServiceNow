1. By using map to field option
2. Giving the same name as field in the table for variable
3. By using the record producer script

 included in the order guide.

Variables: Variables are nothing but the quessionaries where user can input before submitting the items.

variable sets: Set of varibles where we can re use them in the multiple items without recreating them we can store them in the variable sets.

 on the roles, users, groups, department, location etc..
