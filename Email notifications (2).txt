Email Notifications: When ever an ticket is updated or created we will triger the email notifications.

>> Email notifications are disbled in  non production environments, if we want to enable we need to do it in email properties.

>> In Servicenow we can trigger email notifications in 3 ways

1. When a ticket is inserted or created
2. When a ticket is updated
3. When an event is fired (or thorugh business rule)
4. By using workflows


>> Each email notification contains 3 sections,

1. Whom to send
2. When to send
3. What to send

>> To check the email notification in sub prod environments we need to navigate to --> type emails in left navigation bar --> click on emails under system logs

>> To create an event please follow the below path,

type event in the left navigation bar --> unser m policy click on registry

>> Syntax to call the event,

gs.eventQueue('event name', current, parm1, parm2);

>> When there are multiple notifications in the Outbox that are from the same notification Table and addressed to the same recipients, notifications with the highest Weight are sent - the default value 0 causes ServiceNow to always send the notification.
