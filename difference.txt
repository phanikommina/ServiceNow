Difference between Async and after business rule:

After business rules are executed synchronously                                                           Async business rules are executed asynchronously


After BR are used to update the information on related object that needs to be                            Async BR are used to update the information on related object that do not 
display immediately such as glide record queries                                                          display immediately such as calculating metrics and SLA's


we can use current and previous objects in after BR                                                       We can't use previous object in Async BR and current object cannot be reference on delete
