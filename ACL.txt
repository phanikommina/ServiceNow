ACL's (Access control list or access cotnrol rules) : It will control the visibility of the data based on the roles, conditions and script.

ACL: An instance uses access control list (ACL) rules, also called access control rules, to control what data users can access and how they can access it. 
     ACL rules require users to pass a set of requirements in order to gain access to particular data. Each ACL rule specifies:

   1. The object and operation being secured
   2. The permissions required to access the object
   
create: Allows users to insert new records (rows) into a table.
read : Allows users to display records from a table.
write : Allows users to update records in a table.
delete: Allows users to remove records from a table or drop a table.
add_to_list : Allows users to add fields into the list
list_edit : Allows users to update records (rows) from a list view.

>> Admin overrides: Select this check box to have users with the admin role automatically pass the permissions check for this ACL rule. 
Admin users pass regardless of what script or role restrictions apply. However, the nobody role takes precedence over the admin override option. 
If an ACL is assigned the nobody role, admin users cannot access the resource even when Admin overrides is selected. 

1. Table level ACL (tablename.none) : which will apply for the table level restrictions
2. Field level ACL (tablename.*) : which will apply for all the fileds in the table
3. Single field level ACL (tablename.fieldname) : which will apply for the specific field in the table
4. *.none --> it will be applicable for all the tables in instance

5. *.* --> it will be applicable for all the tables and all the fields

** If the user is trying to access the records which they don't have the access they will be prompted with the below message,

>> Security constrains restrcting u to access the requested page.

>> ACL's is going to work based on type and operation

>> ACL's will execute based on the below conditions,

1. Roles
2. Condition
3. Script



* Record level ACL's can be processed in below order,

>> First it will check for any field level ACL is there or not, 
>> then it will check for Table level ACL 


>> If the users who are having field level access, they should have the table level access also.
