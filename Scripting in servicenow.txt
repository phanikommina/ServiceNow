Scripting in Servicenow:

1. Client side scripting : Which will run in the browser end, we can call it as a client side scripting

A) Client scripts: To make any field mandatory, readonly or visible hide etc.. we will use client scripts

I) Onload () : Whenever the form is getting loaded, if we want to do any manupulations to the form like making field mandatory and readonly or hiding the fields etc..
 we will use onload client scripts.
 
II) OnChange () : onchange of one variable or field it will effect on the another field or variable we can use onchange client script

>> We can write onload manupulations in the onchange client script as well.

III) OnSubmit () : Whenever the user is trying to submit the form and if you want to do some manupulations or validations we will use onsubmit client scripts
Iv) OnCellEdit() : whenever user is trying to modify something in the list view, we will use oncelledit client script to restrict it.

B) UI policies : To make any field mandatory, readonly or visible hide etc.. without writing the code we will use UI policies


>> How can we make all variables readonly in the RITM which are coming from the catalog item?

By writing a client script or UI policy and click the checkbox of applies on requeted items.


Syntaxes which we will use in client side scripting is:

Glideform (g_form): https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-application-development/page/app-store/dev_portal/API_reference/GlideForm/concept/c_GlideFormAPI.html
Glideuser (g_user): https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/app-store/dev_portal/API_reference/GlideUser/concept/c_GlideUserAPI.html

Ex syntax: g_form.setMandatory('fieldname', true)





2. Server side scripting : Scripts which will execute in the database level or backend.

A) Business Rules : Business rules will execute in server side which will run when a record is inserted, updated, deleted or when a table is queried.

I) Before :After user submits the form or record and before it reaches to the database, before business rules will execute.
II) After : After user submits the form and after it reaches to database, this BR will execute.
III) Async : Schedular wants to run a schedule job from the business rules, we will use async business rules.
IV) Display : After data read from the database and before presenting to the user.


B) Script includes: We can create no of functions in one script include and we can call them whenever we required. basically script includes will run on
server side but if we need we can run it on the client side also by clicking on client callable checkbox.

I) Server side script includes
II) Cliet callable script includes: We can call the script includes from the client side
